Lab 1.03 - Printing & Variables

Part 1 - Printing Practice
Practice typing out some statements in the editor part of the IDE, then hit "Run" at the top of the screen:
**Remember you must exit() python interpreter before running a script!!!

    Expression                                      Expected Output                               Did anything unexpected happen?
a)  print("1")                                      '1'                                           no quotations
b)  print(1)                                        1                                             no
c)  print(1 + 2)                                    3                                             no
d)  print("1" + "2")                                12                                            no
e)  print("this" + " " + "is" + " " +               this is a sentence                            no
    "a" + " " +
    "sentence" + ".")

Part 2 - Variables Practice
1. In your Console
Type and run the following:
    animal = "dogs"
    print(animal + " are really cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following:
    1. What happens? Prints "dogs are really cool."
    2. How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead? Replace "animal = "dogs"" with "animals = "cats""

2. In your Console
Type and run the following code:
print(dogs + " are cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following questions:
    1. What output does this produce? It produces an error.
    2. Why does this happen? Because "dogs" is not defined as any given statement, it produces an error as it's not signified to print in the command by being surrounded by quotations.
